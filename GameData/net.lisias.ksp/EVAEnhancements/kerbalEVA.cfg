// This ModuleManager code is because the Serenity DLC has duplicate kerbal parts, 
// apparently used to add new modules to an existing kerbal
// This was causing modules to get duplicated.
//
// By only adding to those kerbalEVA parts which do NOT have the ROCScience experiment,
// we ensure that duplicate entries aren't made
