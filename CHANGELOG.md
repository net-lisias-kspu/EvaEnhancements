	Fixed duplicate entries in PAW when BG DLC is installed
		Updated MM script:
			This ModuleManager code is because the Serenity DLC has duplicate kerbal parts, 
			apparently used to add new modules to an existing kerbal
			This was causing modules to get duplicated.
			By only adding to those kerbalEVA parts which do NOT have the ROCScience experiment,
			we ensure that duplicate entries aren't mad
